 
  <h2>Project Introduction</h2> 
<p>Mediagalleries is a project 
made in the first version of JSOP 2010. This project adds media capabilities 
to a joomla application and helps making media galleries, or the next 
generation of galleries(which generally contain only images). 
</p> 
<p>The project is divided into 
a plugin and a component. 
</p> 
<h2>Plugin&#39;s Features:</h2>
<p>The plugin is the back-bone 
of the media capabilities of the component and we can easy create further 
applications on top of that, the component itself is an example of it. 
</p> 
<p>The two main features of plugin 
are: </p> 
<p>      1. 
Embedding Media </p> 
<p>      2. 
Getting Thumbnails </p> 
<p>Currently these features are 
available for  </p>

<h2>Component&#39;s Features:</h2>
<p>The component is called as 
com_mediagalleries. It&#39;s function is to make media-galleries, i.e. Galleries 
that contains all sort of media. It is not possible in a conventional 
gallery to have images, videos, remote site embeds(youtube etc) and 
a lot more. </p> 
<p>Thanks to mediagalleries, 
now it is... with ease, flexibility and power. </p> 
<p>Another feature of mediagalleries 
is to make user channels. i.e. each user of your site can now have a 
different gallery and you(administrator) can have great control over 
that. </p> 
<h2>Why is project important</h2>
<p>There is an very famous concept 
in unix, that everything is a file. Simmilary we can say every non-text 
is media. Let it be a mp3 file , a video , an image even youtube embed 
or java applet. So why should we manage them and embed them in a different 
way everytime? </p> 
<p>This project comes for rescue. 
It simplifies the management of media to a great extent. It can be either 
adding media to your library or just to add some stuff to your posts, 
mediagalleries make it all smooth, simple and extensible. Hence this 
project is of value for the community. 
 </p> 
<h2>Why it should be in 
the CORE?</h2> 
<p>Mediagalleries is made as 
per the Joomla standards and conventions, it is extensible,multilingual,light 
weight,easy to use(work just like most other core components) and a 
lot more. </p> 
<p>Since, all contemporary browsers 
support media, it is hard to imagine a simple text website these days, 
even if it is a simple web log. </p> 
<p>Hence mediagalleries can be 
of a great use for all the administrators and joomla users around the 
world as it will provide the simpler way to manage media and make galleries/channels 
without any complication. 
</p> 
<h2>How JSOP Helped</h2>
<p>Mediagalleries was my first 
large project and my introduction to Joomla programming. I am grateful 
to my mentor Mr Marcelo Eden from the bottom of my heart for being so 
awesome throughout the summer and introducing me to the scary MVC. 
</p> 
<p>We were on Beta 2-3 transition 
when we started and now it&#39;s beta-9 and seems like we have done quite 
some work :) </p> 
<p>I made some cool friends, 
met exciting people and learned more than I ever did in my summer. </p> 
<p>Overall this was the coolest 
summer yet.</p>
